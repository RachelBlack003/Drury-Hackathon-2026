## Reverse Turing Test — Are You AI?

**Reverse Turing Test** is a Pygame-based experimental game that reverses the original idea of the Turing Test.

The world has been overthrown with AI controlling everything. And since AI was built to look human-like, it is difficult to discern if you are human or not.
So, instead of the classic Turing Test where the computer would convince you that they are human, your goal is to convince the system that you are an AI.
Will you convince the interrogator and stay alive? 

Players complete a series of behavioral challenges designed to evaluate patterns such as reaction time, mouse movement, and decision consistency. Based on your performance, the interrogator determines whether you behave more like a human… or a machine.
